          </h3>
          <p>
            SurveyMonkey is a customer feedback company headquartered in San
            Mateo. Throughout my internship, I worked as part of the Billing
            Platforms Team, using primarily Python and SQL, and working with
            several of SurveyMonkey's legacy billing applications. As an intern,
            I communicated daily with my mentor and weekly with my manager, in
            addition to internal communications with the entire team as well as
            cross-functional communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            My tasks involved resolving international tax rate discrepancies
            shown on customer invoices, provisioning new product SKU's,
            deploying a new auto-renewal off flow to all customers globally, and
            correcting credits confirmation emails.

          <p>
            Nova, Tech for Good is a team of students at UCLA who aim to create
            high-impact technology in order to empower nonprofits and better
            serve communities. At Nova, I've been working on two projects:
            Mentor Center, a web application that makes creating an effective
            mentorship program accessible to all, and iiDecide, a platform that
            anonymously connects victims and survivors of sexual assault with
            the same perpetrator.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Mentor Center, I contributed by implementing the feature that
            allows users to rename tags on their cards, and at iiDecide, I
            worked on updating the random username generator to accommodate
            privacy, anonymity, and improve user experience.

          <p>
            Bruinwalk, under the Daily Bruin, serves over 18k students of the
            UCLA community yearly. This site allows students to find next
            classes, share reviews of courses and apartments with others, and
            much more.

          <p>
            Throughout the summer, I worked closesly with 5 other interns to
            push out a fully-fledged redesign of the website. I used HTML, CSS
            and Javascript and worked mainly on frontend engineering; fixing
            bugs on the search results page and implementing a more responsive
            design to fit mobile screens.

          <p>
            I attended a two-week summer program dedicated to educating and
            empowering young women and non-binary students in STEM, where I used
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a fully functional website
            promoting sustainable fashion (2019) and Swift to develop a
            productivity-enhancing mobile app centered around creativity and
            mental health (2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Mobile App Development instructor assistant, I personally
            taught over 30 scholars the fundamentals of Swift and Xcode. By the
            end of our two-week session, scholars were able to create minimum
            viable products of their applications. In addition to teaching
            technicals, I also promoted equity in STEM by leading multiple
            Culture of Technology discussions where we covered topics like race,
            gender and inclusivity.

          <p>
            With a team of 10 students, I helped design and build a robot to
            compete in international tournaments. We have won 4 Design Awards, 1
            Innovate Award, 1 Excellence Award, and a Tournament Champion Award
            at VEX competitions. Additionally, our team placed first in the
            world in the VEX 2021 Electronics Online Challenge, in which we
            disassembled a handheld radio. This allowed us to qualify for the
            2021 VEX World Championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a designer, I worked on the robotics engineering notebook,
            documenting the design, construction, iteration and completion of
            the robot. On the software side, we use a C-based language to
            program our team's robot.

            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Here are some things I've worked on:
          </h1>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Jenny Nuo is my online alias for my indie-pop music career. Through
            my platform, I combine my passion for both music and STEM with songs
            like print(‚Äúi'm so tired‚Äù) [about my experiences as a minority in
            STEM] and valedictorian (about feeings of insecurity and imposter
            syndrome).
          </p>
          <p>
            As an independent artist with no team, I am essentially in charge of
            everything: marketing, promotion, playlisting etc. ‚Äî this includes
            building my official website. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to
            design and create the site.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <a

              href="https://jennywnuo.github.io/aslsignin/Entrepreneurship-Website/index.html"
              >Sign-In ASL Translator App (2020)</a
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sign-In is an application that uses machine learning to convert
            visual sign language cues to text using a phone or tablet camera.
            The purpose of our visual language translation app is to make
            communication with the Deaf community easier when one person does
            not know sign language and it is inefficient to translate. This
            project was entered in Dublin High School's 2020 Entrepreneurship
            Competition and it won first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this project, I worked as the front-end developer,
            creating a website explaining the mission of our app with HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript. Additionally, I worked in research, marketing, as
            well as assisting back-end needs. We focused on using open source
            code and numerous TensorFlow and Google Colab image recognition
            tutorials to create a Python program that recognizes stationary sign
            language cues.
